Make an app like Zomato

Functional Req:
1. User should be able to order food from the app.
2. Restaurants should be able to register with App
3. User should be able to get the status of the delivery of the order



What can be the one happy flow that driver code can demonstrate ?
	1. Create a user
	2. Add a delivery partner
	3. Create a restaurant
	4. Create a dish
	5. Create menu
	5. Add dish to menu
	6. Add menu to restaurant
	7. Register the restaurant with the app
	8. Get the order from the user. (order_id, restaurant, items_list)
	9. Restaurant will prepare food
	10. Restaurant will change the status of the order to ready_for delivery
	11. Delivery Service will deliver the food by choosing a delivery partner.
	(To keep it simple let me assume there are sufficient delivery partners for pick up and will not take care of searching and assigning them the order)


call delivery service.deliver order => no need of notification service

We can have only one
